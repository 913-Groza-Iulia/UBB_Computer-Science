Create a database for the Airbnb application. The entities of interest to the problem domain are: Customers, Properties, 
Bookings and Payments. 
- Each customer has a username, multiple email addresses, nationality and date of birth. Usernames must be unique.
- A property has a name, a description, an address, check in time, check out time, number of people it can accommodate, 
  price per night and a flag indicating if the cancellation is free. A customer can book multiple properties.
- For each booking the system must store the customer, the property, start date and end date of the booking and a list 
  of payments. 
- A payment contains the amount, date of the payment and type (can be online credit card or PayPal). A booking can have 
  multiple partial payments attached.

1. Write a SQL script that creates the corresponding relational data model.
2. Implement a stored procedure that receives the details of one payment and fields) that identify a booking, and adds 
  the payment to the corresponding booking only if the total amount of the existing payments does not exceed the 
  total price of the booking.
3. Create a view that shows the names of the customers that have the maximum number of bookings.
4. Implement a function that returns the number of customers that have less than R bookings paid with PayPal, where 
   R is a function parameter.

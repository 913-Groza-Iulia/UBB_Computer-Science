Create a database to manage the activity of a confectionery store.
• The entities of interest to the problem domain are: Cakes, Cake Types, Orders and Confectionery Chefs
• Each chef has a name, gender, and date of birth.
• Each cake has a name, shape, weight, price, and belongs to a type.
• Each cake type has a name, a description, and can correspond to several cakes.
• A chef can specialize in the preparation of several cakes.
• An order can include several cakes and has a date; a cake can be included in several orders, for every cake purchased 
on an order, the system stores the number of ordered pieces, eg: <order 1: 3 Diplomat Cakes and 2 Cheesecakes>, 
<order 2: 3 Cheesecakes>.

1. Write an SQL script that creates the corresponding relational data model.
2. Implement a stored procedure that receives an order ID, a cake name, and a positive number P representing the number of
ordered pieces, and adds the cake to the order. If the cake is already on the order, the number of ordered pieces is 
set to P.
3. Implement a function that lists the names of the chefs who are specialized in the preparation of all the cakes

Create a database for the Spotify application. The entities of interest to the problem domain are: Songs, Artists,
Accounts and Playlists. 
- Each song has a name, duration in minutes and release date. Duration must be greater than 0 and lower than 20. 
- An artist has a name, country of origin and date of birth. 
- Each song can have one main artist and multiple featuring artists. 
- An account has a username and email address. Usernames must be unique. Both artists and users (accounts) can create 
  playlists. 
- One playlist contains multiple songs and has a name.

1. Write a SQL script that creates the corresponding relational data model.
2. Implement a stored procedure that receives details of an account and stores the account in the database.
3. Create a view that shows the names of the playlists that contain the most songs.
4. Implement a function that returns the number of artists that have created more than R playlists that have a 
   total duration greater than T, where R and T are function parameters.

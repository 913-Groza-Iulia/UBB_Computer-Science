Create a database to manage services offered by a stock exchange. The database will store data about all the 
intermediaries involved in trading. The entities of interest to the problem domain are: Clients, Brokers, StockExchange, 
Stocks and Bonds.
- A client has a name and a unique identification number. Clients can work with multiple brokers. 
- A broker has a name and a list of clients. Brokers can work with multiple stock exchanges. 
- A stock exchange has a list of brokerage companies containing all the brokers the exchange is working with.
- Multiple stocks or bonds can be listed on the same exchange. Both stocks and bonds have a name and 
  the identification number of the client which bought it through a broker.

1. Write an SQL script that creates the corresponding relational data model.
2. Implement a stored procedure that receives a client and returns all the stocks and bonds names bought by the 
   client and also the name of the brokerage company through which the client made the purchases.
3. Create a view that shows all the stocks bought by the clients from a specific brokerage company and the 
   identification numbers of those clients.
4. Implement a function that lists the identification numbers of the clients which are investing in multiple stock 
   exchanges.
